Comprehensive Guide: Deploying and Optimizing Applications on Vercel

1. Troubleshooting Common Deployment Failures on Vercel

1.1: Build Failed / Timeout Error

Possible Causes:

Build process took too long or exceeded the time limit.

Missing environment variables or incorrect settings in vercel.json.

Code or dependencies causing long build times.

How to Fix:

Check Vercel Logs: In your Vercel dashboard, view the deployment logs for errors.

Optimize Build Process:

Reduce build time by using caching strategies (e.g., caching dependencies).

Remove unnecessary or large dependencies.

Split the build into smaller steps if possible.

Increase Timeout Settings: If needed, adjust the timeout settings for your build process in your projectâ€™s settings.

1.2: 404 Errors After Deployment

Possible Causes:

Incorrect file paths.

Routing structure changes not reflected during deployment.

How to Fix:

Check File Paths: Ensure filenames are correctly capitalized and there are no broken links.

Review Routing Configuration: Ensure that dynamic routes (e.g., [param].js in Next.js) are correctly configured.

Clear CDN Cache: Sometimes old cached versions cause 404 errors. Clear the Vercel CDN cache from the Vercel Dashboard.

2. Setting Up Serverless Functions on Vercel

2.1: Basic Setup for Serverless Functions

File Structure:
Create a folder named api/ in your project directory. Inside api/, add a JavaScript file (e.g., hello.js).

Example of a Simple Serverless Function:
// api/hello.js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: "Hello, world!" });
};

Deploying the Function:
Push the changes to Vercel. The function will be available at:
https://your-project-name.vercel.app/api/hello

2.2: Common Serverless Function Issues

Function Timeout Errors:

Cause: Serverless functions have a default time limit (10 seconds).

Fix: Optimize function execution or break it into smaller tasks.

Cold Starts:

Cause: First request after idle time may be slow.

Fix: Keep functions small and efficient.

3. Optimizing Caching and CDN for Fast Deployments

3.1: Understanding Caching in Vercel

Vercel automatically caches static content (images, CSS, JavaScript) at the edge.

Static files are cached by default for 1 hour.

3.2: Custom Caching Strategies

Set cache headers in vercel.json:
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/static/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "Cache-Control", "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

3.3: Clearing CDN Cache

Clear the CDN cache from the Vercel Dashboard to update static assets immediately.

4. Best Practices for Deploying Node.js Apps with Vercel

4.1: Optimizing Build Settings for Node.js

Use .npmrc: Ensure package versions and registries are correctly configured.

Deploy with Docker: For more control, consider using a custom Dockerfile.

4.2: Handling Environment Variables

Set environment variables in the Vercel Dashboard under Project Settings.

5. Deploying Next.js Apps with Vercel

5.1: Creating a Simple Next.js App

Install Next.js:
npx create-next-app my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev

Deploy to Vercel:
Push your Next.js app to GitHub and link it to Vercel. The platform auto-detects the Next.js framework and deploys it.

5.2: SSR vs. SSG in Next.js

SSR (Server-Side Rendering): Use getServerSideProps to fetch data on each request.

SSG (Static Site Generation): Use getStaticProps for building pages at build time.

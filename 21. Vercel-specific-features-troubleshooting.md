# Vercel-Specific Features Troubleshooting

This document covers troubleshooting for various Vercel-specific features that are integral to the deployment and performance of applications.

## 1. Serverless Function Execution Limits
Vercel’s serverless functions have execution time and memory limits. If your functions are hitting these limits, they will fail to deploy or run improperly.

### 1.1 Troubleshooting Function Failures
- **Check Logs**: Look at the deployment logs for specific error messages related to timeout or memory issues.
- **Optimize Code**: Refactor serverless functions to minimize execution time and reduce memory consumption.

### 1.2 Increasing Function Timeout
Vercel allows you to configure the timeout for serverless functions. You may need to increase this limit if your functions require more time to execute.

## 2. Edge Functions Troubleshooting
Edge functions allow you to run JavaScript code closer to the user, improving performance. However, they can be more complex to debug.

### 2.1 Troubleshooting Edge Function Errors
- **Check for Deployment Failures**: Review edge function logs to ensure that deployments are successful.
- **Local Testing**: Use Vercel’s CLI to test your edge functions locally before deploying them.

## 3. Caching and CDN Issues
Sometimes, caching issues can prevent updates from being reflected immediately in your deployed app.

### 3.1 Clearing CDN Cache
- Use the Vercel Dashboard or CLI to manually clear the CDN cache if updates are not appearing.

# Common Customer Issues (Support Scenarios) - Vercel

This document outlines common issues that customers might face with Vercel's platform and provides the best solutions for resolving them.

## 1. **Deployment Failures**

**Issue:** Deployments fail without clear error messages.

### Possible Causes:
- **Invalid `vercel.json` Configuration**: Errors in the `vercel.json` file can prevent deployments.
- **Ignored Build Steps**: Misconfigured build steps can halt deployments.
- **Insufficient Permissions**: Commits from unauthorized contributors may block deployments.

### Solution:
- **Check Build Logs**: Review the build logs in the Vercel dashboard to identify errors.
- **Validate `vercel.json`**: Ensure the `vercel.json` file is correctly formatted.
- **Review Permissions**: Confirm that all contributors have the necessary permissions.

## 2. **404 Errors After Deployment**

**Issue:** The application returns a 404 error despite a successful deployment.

### Possible Causes:
- **Incorrect Output Directory**: Vercel might be serving files from an unintended directory.
- **Misconfigured Routes**: The application's routing may not align with Vercel's expectations.

### Solution:
- **Verify Output Directory**: Ensure the build output directory matches Vercel's configuration.
- **Check Routing Configuration**: Confirm that routes are correctly set up in both the application and `vercel.json`.

## 3. **Serverless Functions Working Locally but Not When Deployed**

**Issue:** Serverless functions operate correctly locally but fail after deployment.

### Possible Causes:
- **Native Dependencies**: Functions rely on native modules not supported in Vercel's environment.
- **Filesystem Access**: Functions attempt to read/write to the filesystem, which isn't persistent in Vercel's serverless environment.
- **Missing Environment Variables**: Environment variables present locally aren't set in the Vercel environment.

### Solution:
- **Use Pure JavaScript Libraries**: Replace native modules with pure JavaScript alternatives.
- **Avoid Filesystem Operations**: Refrain from relying on filesystem persistence; use external storage solutions if necessary.
- **Set Environment Variables**: Define necessary environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.

## 4. **npm run start Not Working on Vercel**

**Issue:** Using `npm run start` as the build command leads to failures.

### Cause:
- Vercel's platform doesn't support running persistent servers; it's designed for static frontends and serverless functions.

### Solution:
- **Use Build Commands**: Set the build command to compile your application (e.g., `npm run build`).
- **Configure Serverless Functions**: Implement server-side logic using Vercel's serverless functions instead of a persistent server.

## 5. **Commits Not Triggering Deployments**

**Issue:** New commits don't initiate deployments on Vercel.

### Possible Causes:
- **Git Integration Issues**: The Git provider isn't correctly integrated with Vercel.
- **Insufficient Permissions**: The commit author lacks the necessary permissions in the Vercel project.

### Solution:
- **Reintegrate Git Provider**: Ensure Vercel is properly connected to your Git provider with the necessary permissions.
- **Verify Commit Author**: Confirm that the commit author is a member of the Vercel project with appropriate access rights.

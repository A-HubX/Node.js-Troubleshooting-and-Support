# Support Escalation Process & Workflow - Vercel

This document outlines the process for escalating support issues within the Vercel platform, including how to collaborate with engineering teams and ensure customer issues are resolved efficiently.

## 1. **Identifying the Issue**

### Step 1: Initial Troubleshooting
- Gather all relevant information: error logs, customer feedback, and platform details.
- Perform basic troubleshooting based on common support scenarios (refer to [Common Customer Issues](common-customer-issues.md)).

### Step 2: Categorize the Issue
- **General Inquiry**: Answer customer questions or provide standard documentation.
- **Technical Issue**: Requires investigation and potential resolution.
- **Incident Management**: High priority issues that may involve outages or critical failures.

## 2. **Escalating to Engineering**

### Step 1: When to Escalate
- If the issue persists after initial troubleshooting or is beyond the capabilities of the support team.
- For complex or highly technical issues that require deeper investigation by the engineering team.

### Step 2: Provide Necessary Information
- Include **error logs**, **reproduction steps**, **support tickets**, and **system configurations** in the escalation report.
- Clearly state the **impact** of the issue (e.g., number of affected users, criticality, etc.).

### Step 3: Communicate with Engineering
- Use the designated **escalation channels** (e.g., Slack, internal ticketing system).
- Provide **regular updates** to the engineering team and inform the customer of progress.

## 3. **Internal Communication and Documentation**

### Step 1: Informing Relevant Teams
- Notify the **Customer Success Team** about escalations to keep them in the loop for customer updates.
- Share detailed **root cause analysis** and **workaround solutions** with the internal teams for knowledge sharing.

### Step 2: Updating Customer
- After resolution, communicate findings, fixes, or workarounds clearly to the customer.
- Ensure customers feel supported and that the issue has been resolved to their satisfaction.

## 4. **Post-Escalation Follow-up**

### Step 1: Documenting the Incident
- After the issue is resolved, document the entire escalation process.
- Update knowledge base with **new solutions** or **workarounds** that can be referenced in future support cases.

### Step 2: Continuous Improvement
- Analyze common issues to identify patterns.
- Improve internal tools, documentation, and processes to reduce future escalations.

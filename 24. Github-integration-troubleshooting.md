# GitHub Integration Troubleshooting for Vercel Deployments

Vercel integrates seamlessly with GitHub to automate deployments. This document provides troubleshooting tips for any issues related to GitHub integration.

## 2. Build Errors from GitHub Commits
Sometimes, builds fail due to issues in the codebase after a commit.

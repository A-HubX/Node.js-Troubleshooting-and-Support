# Incident Management SOP (Standard Operating Procedures)

This document outlines the procedures for managing incidents at Vercel, ensuring swift resolution and effective communication to minimize downtime and impact on customers.

---

## 1. Incident Identification

**Triggering an Incident:**  
- An incident is identified when a significant issue, such as a system outage or critical bug, is reported or detected. This may include:
  - Platform downtime
  - Unresponsive services
  - Major service degradation
  - Critical security vulnerabilities

**Escalation Criteria:**  
- Issues that impact multiple customers or prevent core functionality are immediately escalated.
- Incidents that are complex or involve potential data loss should be escalated to the engineering team.

---

## 2. Incident Categorization

**Critical:**  
- Affects all or most of the platform’s core functionality.
- Requires immediate action and a full team response.

**Major:**  
- Affects some customers or functionality but does not bring down the entire platform.
- Resolution is necessary but can be handled with a reduced response team.

**Minor:**  
- Does not significantly affect functionality but requires fixing.
- Can be resolved in a slower time frame.

## 3. Incident Communication

**Internal Communication:**  
- Inform all relevant teams (e.g., engineering, product) about the incident’s nature, scope, and progress.
- Use internal communication tools such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, or email for timely updates.

**Customer Communication:**  
- Notify customers affected by the incident. Ensure clear communication about:
  - The nature of the issue
  - What is being done to resolve it
  - Estimated time to resolution (if available)
  - Any workarounds or alternative solutions

**Transparency:**  
- Be transparent with customers about the incident, even if it means communicating uncertainty about timelines.
- Update customers regularly with progress and status reports.

---

## 4. Incident Resolution

**Root Cause Analysis (RCA):**  
- After resolution, conduct a thorough investigation to determine the root cause of the incident.
- Use tools like logs, monitoring dashboards, and historical data to identify the issue's source.

**Fix Implementation:**  
- Once the root cause is determined, implement a fix or workaround.
- Ensure that the fix does not introduce new issues or degrade the platform’s performance.

**Testing:**  
- Before closing the incident, ensure the fix is tested in a staging or production-like environment.
- Verify that the solution works across all affected regions and services.

---

## 5. Post-Incident Review

**Incident Report:**  
- Document the incident, including:
  - Incident timeline
  - Impact assessment
  - Root cause
  - Steps taken to resolve the issue
  - Recommendations for preventing similar incidents in the future

**Improvement Action:**  
- Identify process improvements, tools, or training that could help prevent similar incidents.
- Review any gaps in incident detection, communication, or resolution that could be improved.

---

## 6. Incident Closure

**Incident Closure Criteria:**  
- The incident is closed once the issue is fully resolved, and customer impact has been minimized or removed.
- Ensure customers are notified that the issue has been resolved and services are fully restored.

**Post-Mortem Review:**  
- Schedule a post-mortem review with relevant stakeholders, including engineers, product managers, and customer support teams, to discuss the incident in detail and identify areas for improvement.

**Feedback Loop:**  
- Collect feedback from affected teams and customers to refine the incident management process.

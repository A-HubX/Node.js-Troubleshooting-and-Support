# SaaS Troubleshooting Playbook

This playbook provides a guide for troubleshooting common issues faced by SaaS applications, including scaling, data storage, and security. It focuses on proactive solutions to ensure the stability and performance of Vercel services.

## 1. Scaling Issues

### Symptoms:
- Application performance degrades under heavy traffic.
- Serverless functions experience delays or timeouts.
- Users experience slow load times or unresponsiveness.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
- **Check Resource Usage:**  
  Monitor the current resource allocation for your application (e.g., CPU, memory, network). Use Vercel’s monitoring tools to track scaling metrics.

- **Adjust Scaling Settings:**  
  Review scaling settings in your `vercel.json` file and increase the allowed scale for serverless functions or deployment regions if necessary.

- **Optimize Code:**  
  Profile the application’s codebase for bottlenecks. Use techniques such as caching, lazy loading, and reducing database calls to optimize performance.

## 2. Data Storage and Management

### Symptoms:
- Data is not being saved or retrieved properly.
- Database queries are slow or return incorrect results.
- Users experience data loss or corruption.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
- **Check Database Connectivity:**  
  Ensure that the database connection is active and configured correctly. Verify that environment variables for database access (e.g., host, username, password) are set properly in Vercel.

- **Inspect Data Integrity:**  
  Review the application’s database schema and logs for any integrity violations. Run consistency checks on the database.

- **Optimize Database Queries:**  
  Look for slow queries and optimize them by indexing, caching, or using more efficient query structures. 

- **Backup and Restore:**  
  Always have a backup strategy for your database. If data corruption occurs, restore from the last known good backup.

## 3. Authentication and Authorization

### Symptoms:
- Users are unable to log in or authenticate with the system.
- Authorization issues prevent users from accessing certain features or resources.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
- **Check Authentication Flow:**  
  Review the authentication logic for bugs or misconfigurations in the OAuth, JWT, or session management code. Ensure tokens are valid and not expired.

- **Validate Permissions:**  
  Ensure that user roles and permissions are correctly assigned in the system. Check the access control policies to ensure users have the correct privileges.

- **Check Third-Party Integrations:**  
  If your application uses third-party authentication providers (e.g., Google, GitHub), verify the integration is working and there are no outages or disruptions in the service.

## 4. Security Issues

### Symptoms:
- Unexpected data exposure or breaches.
- Unauthorized access or security vulnerabilities.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
- **Audit Security Logs:**  
  Check system and application logs for any suspicious activity, such as unauthorized login attempts or unusual requests.

- **Review Permissions and Roles:**  
  Review the access control policies and ensure that users only have the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.

- **Patch Vulnerabilities:**  
  Ensure that all dependencies and libraries are up to date, and vulnerabilities are patched. Use security tools like Dependabot to automatically check for outdated or vulnerable dependencies.

- **Data Encryption:**  
  Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Review SSL/TLS certificates and other encryption settings to ensure they are correctly configured.

## 5. Incident Response

### Symptoms:
- Platform outages or major issues affecting a large number of users.
- Service interruptions due to unexpected incidents.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
- **Identify and Categorize Incident:**  
  Use monitoring and alerting tools to identify the nature of the incident. Categorize the issue based on severity and impact.

- **Communicate with Customers:**  
  Notify affected customers about the issue, provide regular updates, and share the estimated resolution time.

- **Root Cause Analysis:**  
  Once the incident is resolved, conduct a root cause analysis to determine what went wrong and implement measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

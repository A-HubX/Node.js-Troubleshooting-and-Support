# Internal Support Tools (Scripts, Automation) - Vercel

This document provides an overview of internal support tools, scripts, and automation solutions used by the support team to streamline troubleshooting, improve efficiency, and reduce resolution time for customer issues.

## 1. **Automated Error Reporting Script**

### Purpose:
- Automates the process of collecting error logs and system diagnostics for common issues, making it easier to gather the necessary information before escalating issues.

### Features:
- Collects logs from the Vercel platform.
- Gathers system configuration and environment details.
- Sends logs directly to the support ticket for easy access by the team.

### Usage:
```bash
# Command to run the automated error reporting script
./collect_logs.sh --output logs/

2. Deployment Check Tool
Purpose:
Automates the process of checking deployment statuses and verifying common misconfigurations that lead to build or deployment failures.

Features:
Checks the current build status of Vercel deployments.

Verifies the vercel.json file for common misconfigurations.

Outputs a report with suggested fixes.

Usage:
# Command to run the deployment check tool
./check_deployment.sh --project my-vercel-project

3. Environment Variable Management Script
Purpose:
Simplifies the process of managing environment variables across multiple Vercel projects, ensuring they are properly set before deployment.

Features:
Lists all environment variables set for a given project.

Adds or removes environment variables in bulk.

Exports environment variables for backup.

Usage:
# Command to list environment variables for a project
./manage_env_vars.sh --project my-vercel-project --list

# Command to add environment variable
./manage_env_vars.sh --project my-vercel-project --add VAR_NAME=value

4. Support Automation Bot
Purpose:
Automates common support workflows, including ticket creation, customer follow-ups, and troubleshooting tasks.

Features:
Sends automated responses for common issues.

Creates support tickets automatically based on predefined triggers (e.g., a certain error message).

Assigns tickets to the appropriate support agents based on the issue type.

Usage:
# Command to trigger automated response
./support_bot.sh --ticket_id 12345 --response "We've received your request and will get back to you shortly."

5. System Monitoring and Alerts
Purpose:
Monitors key system metrics related to deployments and serverless functions, alerting the support team when there are abnormal behaviors.

Features:
Monitors deployment statuses, serverless function performance, and error rates.

Sends alerts through Slack or email when predefined thresholds are met.

Usage:
# Command to start monitoring system metrics
./monitor_system.sh --start --alert_on_error

6. Knowledge Base Search Tool
Purpose:
Helps support agents quickly find relevant articles, troubleshooting guides, or solutions from the internal knowledge base.

Features:
Searches the internal knowledge base using keywords or issue categories.

Returns a list of articles relevant to the issue.

Helps agents reduce resolution time by providing immediate access to solutions.

Usage:
# Command to search the knowledge base
./search_kb.sh --query "404 error deployment"

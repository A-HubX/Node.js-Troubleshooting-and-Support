# Performance Monitoring & Troubleshooting on Vercel

When deploying applications on Vercel, monitoring performance is crucial to ensure that they are running optimally. This document provides guidance on how to monitor and troubleshoot performance issues related to your Vercel deployment.

## 1. Identifying Performance Issues
Common indicators of performance issues include:
- Slow page loads
- Latency spikes in serverless functions
- High memory usage in serverless functions

### 1.1 Checking Deployment Logs
Vercel provides detailed logs for each deployment. Review these logs to identify performance bottlenecks, such as unoptimized serverless function executions or long-running tasks.

### 1.2 Vercel Analytics
Vercel offers built-in analytics tools that help monitor:
- Response times
- Traffic spikes
- CPU and memory usage in serverless functions

## 2. Troubleshooting Performance Problems
Here are some common troubleshooting steps:
- **Optimize Serverless Functions**: Check if your serverless functions are performing too many synchronous tasks or consuming excessive resources.
- **Enable Edge Caching**: Caching content on the edge can reduce load times significantly. Ensure that static assets are being served from Vercel’s CDN.

## 3. Best Practices for Optimizing Performance
- **Minimize Serverless Function Execution Time**: Refactor long-running functions.
- **Use Caching Efficiently**: Cache static assets to reduce server-side rendering time.
- **Optimize Images and Assets**: Use Vercel’s automatic image optimization tools to reduce load times.

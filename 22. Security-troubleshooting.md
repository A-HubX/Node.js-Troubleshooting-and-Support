# Security Troubleshooting for Vercel Deployments

Ensuring the security of your Vercel deployment is crucial for both your users and your data. This document provides guidance on troubleshooting and securing your Vercel deployments.

## 1. Misconfigured Environment Variables
Improperly configured environment variables can expose sensitive information or prevent your application from functioning correctly.

### 1.1 Troubleshooting Environment Variables
- Ensure that all environment variables are correctly set in the Vercel Dashboard.
- Check for any missing or incorrect values by reviewing deployment logs.

## 2. Access Control Issues
Vercel allows you to manage access control at different levels, including team and project permissions.

### 2.1 Troubleshooting Access Denied Errors

- Ensure that the correct users or services have access to your deployment.

## 3. Secure API Key Management
Improper handling of API keys can lead to unauthorized access to your application.

### 3.1 Storing API Keys Securely
- Always store API keys and sensitive information in Vercelâ€™s environment variables rather than hardcoding them in your codebase.

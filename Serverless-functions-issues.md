### 3. **Serverless Functions Working Locally but Not When Deployed**

**Issue:** Serverless functions operate correctly locally but fail after deployment.

**Possible Causes:**

- **Native Dependencies:** Functions rely on native modules not supported in Vercel's environment.

- **Filesystem Access:** Functions attempt to read/write to the filesystem, which isn't persistent in Vercel's serverless environment.

- **Missing Environment Variables:** Environment variables present locally aren't set in the Vercel environment.
